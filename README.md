Hello.

Photo Flip is an interactive web project created to display images and allow users to navigate through different pages by clicking on them. 
Soon I will be adding more content and animations to spice things up.


To go to the project, you can clone this repo using:
https://github.com/Jenni4B/LaunchpadProject.git
