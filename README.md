Photo Flip is an interactive web project created to display images and allow users to navigate through different pages by clicking on them. Soon I will be adding more content and animations to spice things up.

To go to the project, you can clone this repo using: https://github.com/Jenni4B/LaunchpadProject.git

or hit this link: https://jenni4b.github.io/LaunchpadProject/

Update October 1st: The like and dislike button can be toggled! Enjoy!
Update October 3rd: Click on the image to make it bigger!
