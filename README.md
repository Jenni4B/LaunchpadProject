Hello.

Photo Flip is an interactive web project created to display images and allow users to navigate through different pages by clicking on them. 
Clicking on two of the images redirects users to additional pages. These pages are currently placeholders but contain a Home button that lets you return to the main page.
The third image links to a YouTube video. One day I hope to add content to the additional pages and animations or transitions when navigating between pages.
